# Fast Obstacle Avoidance
This is a more developer-oriented README. Going into strcuture and things todo about the code.

## TODO
- Refactoring of obstacle-avoider:  
  The obstacle avoider should be refactored, such that it does not require the robot model (especially for the laser avoider).
  A 'standalone' method should just allow avoiding of the surrounding.
  See the matlab funciton VFH for info.
