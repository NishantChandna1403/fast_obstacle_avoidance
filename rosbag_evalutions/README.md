# Rosbag Evaluations of Fast Obstacle Avoidance
Several scripts are presented to evaluate the algorithm on real sensor data. 
The evaluation requires ROS-python installation `rospy` to evaluate the data.

The rosbag evaluation scripts are provided to give an example on how to use the library with ros.
However, to obtain the rosbbags / data, contact the authors of the repository.
